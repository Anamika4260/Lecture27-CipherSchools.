Data Structure is a branch of Computer Science. The study of data structure allows us to understand the organization of data and the management of the data flow in order to increase the efficiency of any process or program. Data Structure is a particular way of storing and organizing data in the memory of the computer so that these data can easily be retrieved and efficiently utilized in the future when required. The data can be managed in various ways, like the logical or mathematical model for a specific organization of data is known as a data structure.

The scope of a particular data model depends on two factors:

First, it must be loaded enough into the structure to reflect the definite correlation of the data with a real-world object.
Second, the formation should be so straightforward that one can adapt to process the data efficiently whenever necessary.
